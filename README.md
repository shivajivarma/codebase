Code Base
===========

'__[Code Base](http://shivajivarma.com/code-base)__' is a repository contains examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. 

## Data Structures

Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

* [Stack](http://shivajivarma.com/code-base/2018/06/01/stack/)

## Algorithms

Algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithm is a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.
